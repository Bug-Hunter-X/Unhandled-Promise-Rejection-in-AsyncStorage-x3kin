In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store data, a common error is not handling the potential for rejected promises.  If a write or read operation to AsyncStorage fails (e.g., due to device storage issues or a corrupted database), the promise will be rejected.  If this rejection isn't caught, the app might crash or exhibit unexpected behavior.

Example of problematic code:

```javascript
AsyncStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue')
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Value set!');
  });
```

This code only handles the successful resolution of the promise.  If `setItem` fails, the app will continue without an error message, potentially leading to silent data loss or other subtle issues.
